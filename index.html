            <h2>Reading</h2>
            <img src="reading%20gif.gif">
            <p>'Recreational activity' refers to some activity which keeps you occupied happy which you like to do. For example I like doing many recreational activities like playing keyboard, cycling, art and craft, singing, talking, dancing, yoga, skipping etc. But the most I like is reading.</p>
            <p2>I do a lot of reading. I love reading books especially 'The Famous Five' series by Enid Mary Blyton. Enid Blyton is my all time favourite authoress. A few days ago I got a book from school library and completed it reading after 4 days ago. Without reading atleast once in a day, I can't sleep a wink at night so, I regularly read every night and sometimes in my freetimes.</p2>
            <p3>Reading is a very benefecial activity. It improves our language and vocubulary. It improves our reading skills, speed, mental ability and general knowledge. I don't relaly think there is any disadvantage of reading but we should not spend our whole day in reading. We should play also to remain fit and healthy.</p3>
            <p4>Reading every child should do each day atleast 5 pages. While reading find some new words and find their meaning to improve your vocabulary. I f you don't know check on the web or in the dictionary. Without reading we would be dumb so, read for your own benefit, not for me nor for somebody else. At the end I would like to say:</p4>
            <h1 id="heading1">PAGE BY PAGE, BOOK BY BOOK, NO NEED TO WAIT, JUST TAKE A LOOK!!</h1>
